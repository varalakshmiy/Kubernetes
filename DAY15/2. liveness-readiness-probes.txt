How much time should I send the request?when pod is up continuously send req,container throw some issues,when pod up dev wait for sometime after send req,intial delay sec ,mention in those time in yaml file,liveness prob check appli health status,
---------------------------------
Liveness probe and Readiness probe
==================================

--> Liveness and Readiness Probes are mechanisms in Kubernetes used to check the health and status of containers within a Pod. 
They help ensure that applications are running as expected and can serve traffic.



IP:NodePort/maven-web-application  


Liveness Probe
-----------------
Suppose that a Pod is running our application inside a container, but due to some reason letâ€™s say memory leak, cpu usage, application deadlock etc the
application is not responding to our requests, and stuck in error state.

Liveness probe checks the container health as we tell it do, and if  some reason the liveness probe fails, it restarts the container.
-if container failure based on values we define,it restart container.

Readiness Probe: this is container is ready or not to accept traffic.
---------------
This type of probe is used to detect if a container is ready to accept traffic. You can use this probe to manage which pods are used as backends for load balancing services. 

If a pod is not ready,  then be removed from the list of load balancers.
