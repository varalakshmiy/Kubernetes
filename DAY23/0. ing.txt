Ingress in Kubernetes

Definition:
Ingress is an API object in Kubernetes that manages external access to services within a cluster, usually HTTP/HTTPS. 
It provides a single entry point to route traffic to multiple services based on rules.

Key Points:
1. Single Entry Point - Acts like a gateway for all external requests.
2. Requires Ingress Controller - NGINX, HAProxy, Traefik etc. implement the rules.
3. Routing Rules - Based on hostnames (shop.example.com) or paths (/cart, /orders).
4. TLS/SSL Termination - Can handle HTTPS traffic using TLS certificates.
5. Load Balancing - Provides HTTP-level load balancing across backend pods.

Example Ingress YAML:
-----------------------------------
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: shop-ingress
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host: shop.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /cart
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: cart-service
            port:
              number: 80
      - path: /orders
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: order-service
            port:
              number: 80
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - shop.example.com
    secretName: shop-tls-secret
-----------------------------------

Simple Explanation:
Without Ingress: Each service needs a LoadBalancer or NodePort (costly and complex).
With Ingress: One entry point + smart routing to different services (simpler and cheaper).

Example Routing:
- shop.example.com/cart  --> Cart service
- shop.example.com/orders --> Orders service
